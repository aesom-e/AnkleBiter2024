2024-07-16
-> Started the rebuild of the codebase due to errors
--> Original AnkleBiter code gave the error that the CAN bus was overused
-> YAGSL Config started
--> Installed the vendor libraries suggested for use
---> https://maven.ctr-electronics.com/release/com/ctre/phoenix6/latest/Phoenix6-frc2024-latest.json
---> https://software-metadata.revrobotics.com/REVLib-2024.json
---> https://dev.studica.com/releases/2024/NavX.json
---> https://frcsdk.reduxrobotics.com/ReduxLib_2024.json
---> https://3015rangerrobotics.github.io/pathplannerlib/PathplannerLib.json
---> https://broncbotz3481.github.io/YAGSL-Lib/yagsl/yagsl.json
--> Placed the swerve config files from the previous version of AnkleBiter into /src/main/deploy

2024-07-17
-> YAGSL Config continued
--> Created the subsystem and commands based on https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/
--> Imported the constants from the previous version of AnkleBiter
-> Installed PhotonLib (A library which accompanies PhotonVision)
--> https://maven.photonvision.org/repository/internal/org/photonvision/photonlib-json/1.0/photonlib-json-1.0.json

2024-07-19
-> Swerve drive code created
--> TeleopDrive command created
--> Xbox Controller attached to the swerve subsystem
-> First test of the robot simulator

2024-07-20
-> First test of the rewrite, wheels turn
--> CAN frame not recieved/too stale error encountered still
---> May be a hardware issue at this point, but the drivetrain still works
-> Limelight subsystem rewritten
-> Added tags to all SmartDashboard entries produced by the program

2024-07-22
-> Swerve doesn't act as expected while testing, fixing started
--> The wheels turned in seemingly random directions and robot moved nowhere 
--> Shuffleboard was reporting crazy numbers, and "fixing" one module led to another breaking
--> Nothing seemed to work
---> Changed absoluteEncoderOffset many times

2024-07-23
-> Swapped roboRIO and NavX boards
--> Somehow it got worse

2024-08-07
-> Diagnosis started with Phoenix Tuner X
--> No CAN Bus Devices were detected
-> USB B connection to RIO failing and there is no communication between my laptop and it
-> Fixed all the problems with swerve
--> Adam may or may not have plugged the motors into the wrong power port drawing 1V less than they require
--> Lesson: When the programmer says they are getting errors about hardware (note my comment on the 20th of last month), it's probably hardware
-> Field relativily wasn't working
-> Started working on a directional drive command for auto targetting April Tags detected by the Limelight

2024-08-08
-> The directional drive command was scrapped in favour of directly interfacing with the swerve subsystem from the Limelight subsystem
-> Limelight driving forwards when an April Tag is seen, stops when none are present
-> Swerve drive not moving perfectly straight, but for now that will be ignored
--> Another thing to note is that one of the treads on the wheels was replaced Today, so that might be the cause of the issue
-> Though a little bit awkward, movement forwards backwards and rotation work with the April Tags
-> Regreased the wheels and grinded down sharp screws poking into the bellypan
-> Attached the speed of the motion in the Limelight library to the right trigger of the Xbox Controller

2024-08-10
-> Increased the resolution of the image streamed from the Limelight
-> Tried to start on the Orange Pi, but Adam glued it to the baseplate and it wouldn't come off
--> He hammered it off, any future problems with the Pi may be attributed to this
